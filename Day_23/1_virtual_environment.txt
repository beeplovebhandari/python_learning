There may be different projects in your system with different requirement of Packages
Your One Project may require pandas version 2.1 whereas other project may require pandas version 2.4
So ro solve this problem we can use the concept of vritual environment 

Virtual environment is a separate environment in your system where we can install Packages in isolated form for each project.

Important Commands

1. python -m venv venv
        ==> Creates a new virtual environment

2. venv\Scripts\activate (for windows devices in commamnd prompt)
   source venv/bin/activate
        ==> activate the virtual environment

3. deactivate
        ==> it deactivatethe virtual environment

4. pip install <package_name>
        ==> it install the packages to the environment

5. pip freeze
        ==> it shows all the installed packages in the environment
