1. git branch   
    ==> List all the branches and highlights the active branch 

2. git branch <branch_name>
    ==> Creates a new branch 

3. git checkout <branch_name>
    ==> Jumps to the branch name provided

4. git checkout -b <branch_name>
    ==> Step 2 and 3 can be obtained from this single command i.e. create a new branch and jump to 
    that newly created branch with all the codes from existing branch.
