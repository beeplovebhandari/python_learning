On developing apps or products, we may have different versions of that product . If the new versions is updated then , the previous version code should also maintained.
So, such maintaining of versions is carried by version control system . There are different version control system like git , mercurial, perforce etc..

Need of Version Control System:-

==> To maintain product versions.
==> For team collaboration in a project.


The codes of project should be stored somewhere in the cloud . Google drive or any other storage services can be used for storing code, but they doesn't provide git support 
and there will be more manual work for team collaboration. So, we use cloud service which understand git instead of google drives.
The example of such cloud service which understand git are , GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc..
