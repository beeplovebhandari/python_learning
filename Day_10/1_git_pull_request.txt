1. While working on a professional project we do not merge code from other branches to the main branches in local.
2. The codes in the main branch should always go through a review process known as Pull Request .
3. Pull Request is opened in the github. It can be opened by selectig two branches; one branch is the feature branch and another is the main branch .
